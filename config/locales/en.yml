  waterfall_description: "The waterfall model is a sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance."
  scrum_description: "Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development method for managing software projects and product or application development. Scrum has not only reinforced the interest in project management,[citation needed] but also challenged the conventional ideas about such management. Scrum focuses on project management institutions where it is difficult to plan ahead. Mechanisms of empirical process control, where feedback loops that constitute the core management technique are used as opposed to traditional command-and-control oriented management.It represents a radically new approach for planning and managing projects, bringing decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties."
  xp_description: "Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent 'releases' in short development cycles (timeboxing), which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted."
  rup_description: "The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software Corporation, a division of IBM since 2003.[1] RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process framework, intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. RUP is a specific implementation of the Unified Process."
  rad_description: "Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The 'planning' of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements."
  waterfall_requirements_phase_description: "A phase to gather project requirements"
  waterfall_design_phase_description: "A phase to create design documents"
  waterfall_development_phase_description: "The main development phase for the project"
  waterfall_test_phase_description: "A quality assurance phase"
  waterfall_deploy_phase_description: "Phase to deploy the application and deliver it to customers"
  scrum_exploration_phase_description: "This phase includes development of the architectural spike and the development of the initial user stories."
  scrum_planning_phase_description: "This phase includes drafting story cards and meeting with the customer to agree on scope."
  scrum_sprint_phase_description: "Phase to work on stories for the iteration."
  scrum_review_phase_description: "Meeting for developers to demonstrate their work and receive feedback."
  xp_exploration_phase_description: "This phase includes development of the architectural spike and the development of the initial user stories."
  xp_planning_phase_description: "This phase includes drafting story cards and meeting with the customer to agree on scope."
  xp_iteration_phase_description: "Phase to work on stories for the iteration."
  xp_review_phase_description: "Meeting for developers to demonstrate their work and receive feedback."
  rad_requirements_planning_phase_description: "Combines elements of the system planning and systems analysis phases of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Users, managers, and IT staff members discuss and agree on business needs, project scope, constraints, and system requirements. It ends when the team agrees on the key issues and obtains management authorization to continue."
  rad_user_design_phase_description: "During this phase, users interact with systems analysts and develop models and prototypes that represent all system processes, inputs, and outputs. The RAD groups or subgroups typically use a combination of Joint Application Development (JAD) techniques and CASE tools to translate user needs into working models. User Design is a continuous interactive process that allows users to understand, modify, and eventually approve a working model of the system that meets their needs."
  rad_construction_phase_description: "Focuses on program and application development task similar to the SDLC. In RAD, however, users continue to participate and can still suggest changes or improvements as actual screens or reports are developed. Its tasks are programming and application development, coding, unit-integration and system testing."
  rad_cutover_phase_description: "Resembles the final tasks in the SDLC implementation phase, including data conversion, testing, changeover to the new system, and user training. Compared with traditional methods, the entire process is compressed. As a result, the new system is built, delivered, and placed in operation much sooner. Its tasks are data conversion, full-scale testing, system changeover, user training."
  rup_inception_phase_description: "The primary objective is to scope the system adequately as a basis for validating initial costing and budgets. In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.), and financial forecast is established."
  rup_elaboration_phase_description: "The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase. The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and the architecture of the project gets its basic form."
  rup_construction_phase_description: "The primary objective is to build the software system. In this phase, the main focus is on the development of components and other features of the system. This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place. In larger projects, several construction iterations may be developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments that produce demonstrable prototypes."
  rup_transition_phase_description: "The primary objective is to \'transit\' the system from development into production, making it available to and understood by the end user. The activities of this phase include training the end users and maintainers and beta testing the system to validate it against the end users\' expectations. The product is also checked against the quality level set in the Inception phase."
