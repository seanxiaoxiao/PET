  waterfall_description: "The waterfall model is a sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance."
  scrum_description: "Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development method for managing software projects and product or application development. Scrum has not only reinforced the interest in project management,[citation needed] but also challenged the conventional ideas about such management. Scrum focuses on project management institutions where it is difficult to plan ahead. Mechanisms of empirical process control, where feedback loops that constitute the core management technique are used as opposed to traditional command-and-control oriented management.It represents a radically new approach for planning and managing projects, bringing decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties."
  xp_description: "Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent 'releases' in short development cycles (timeboxing), which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted."
  rup_description: "The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software Corporation, a division of IBM since 2003.[1] RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process framework, intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. RUP is a specific implementation of the Unified Process."
  rad_description: "Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The 'planning' of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements."
  requirements_phase_description: "A phase to gather project requirements"
  design_phase_description: "A phase to create design documents"
  development_phase_description: "The main development phase for the project"
  test_phase_description: "A quality assurance phase"
  deploy_phase_description: "Phase to deploy the application and deliver it to customers"
